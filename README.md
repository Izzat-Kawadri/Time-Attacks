# Time-Attacks

## Overview

This project is a **Unity 3D first-person shooter (FPS) game** developed as part of a Coursera course. The project started as a guided training on creating a simple FPS game, and then expanded with additional features and levels to make it unique.

The game currently includes:
- First-person view, where the player controls a character to shoot targets.
- A dynamic scoring system, time bonuses, and penalties based on different target types.
- Two levels, each with distinct gameplay mechanics and enemy interactions.

The game is still in **development**, with plans for more features, improvements, and eventual release on game stores.

## Features

### Level 1
- **White Cube**: Adds extra time when shot.
- **Yellow Cube**: Deducts time when shot.
- **Green Cube**: Increases the player's score.
- **Level Progression**: Upon reaching a score threshold (e.g., 50 points), the player advances to the next level. A loading screen with shootable buttons transitions the player to the next level.

### Level 2 (New Feature Addition)
- **Angry Birds Characters**: Targets are replaced by "Angry Birds" characters, each with specific actions.
- **Red Angry Bird (Enemy)**: The player loses the game if the Red Angry Bird collides with them. The player must shoot the Red Angry Bird to survive.
- **Other Angry Birds**: Shooting other Angry Birds gives the player time and score boosts.
- **New Level Design**: A more challenging and engaging level that introduces new gameplay dynamics.
